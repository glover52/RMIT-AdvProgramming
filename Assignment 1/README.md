## Comments:
- The assignment was fairly simple and only took some time to get rolling due to me not knowing where to start.

- The skeleton code's comments got really annoying in VIM and so I resorted to deleting the large chunks of comments as they were the same (and could be updated) via the reference link given to us, which outlines what each file does
and how they are related to each other. This made it easier for me as a programmer as I didn't need to constantly scroll through 50 lines of code in between each function looking for what I wanted.

- Although I deleted that large chunks of comments, I added many of my own that hopefully explains the process of what is happening
very easily for anyone reading it. I tried as best as I could to have as much detail as possible within a limit of 80 characters per line.

- One major problem I had was being unable to find a better method of checking the board for a win from either player with the given
time on this assignment, I would have liked to reduce it in some way rather than having four nested loops each with three loops and
I see it as a very big waste of resources, knowing that there was another, more simpler way I could have done the win checks.

- Overall, I liked the assignment and it was a very basic but moderately difficult challenge to overcome. I can't wait to see what's next!
