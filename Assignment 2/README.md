## Comments:

1. Upon adding an item for the very first item, valgrind runs an error in which is states "Conditional jump or move depends on unintialised value(s)" which occurs wherever the items are listed. I could not find anything wrong in gdb after going through it multiple times and printing EVERYTHING in the list. Also upon adding a second item or more, this error NEVER appears again. Furthermore this only starting happening in the last day, in which I wish I had the time to post about it whilst frantically typing away. Please be a little bit forgiving on this!

2. The provided example had alphabetical order with Capital Letters first, lowercase next and numbers last. In the essence of time organisation, I have decided to adopt this as well.
	
3. With '{ }' brackets, I tried to adopt putting them after the statement in order to present a cleaner looking code, i'm sure I've missed a couple that remained after switching to this presentation.
	
4. With 3. being said, there may also be a couple of single lines of (commented) code/functions that have remained after submission. I had hoped to remove them all, which means I must have missed a couple if there is one.

5. Good assignment!
