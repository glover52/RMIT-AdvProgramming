# Advanced Programming Techniques Assignments
These are both of my assignment submissions for Advanced Programming Techniques at RMIT. Both projects were coded using the C language and was thoroughly tested using gdb, valgrind and splint.

## Running programs
Running both assignments requires a linux command line, or something else that can run compiled C program files.

Assignment 1
> ./con4

Assignment 2
> ./ppd

## Assignment 1 Details
```
Concepts covered include :
- Data types and basic operators.
- Branching and looping programming constructs.
- Basic input and output functions.
- Strings.
- Functions.
- Pointers.
- Arrays.
- modularisation
- C Structs

We have decided this year to provide you what will be a fun assignment, a two player version of the game “Connect 4”. Connect 4 is a rather simple game. Players take it in turns to place a token in a column on a board – the placed token drops down that column to the last available cell for it. Each player attempts to get four of their tokens in a row while blocking the opposing player for achieving the same objective.

Before the game begins, the human player will be given the opportunity to enter their name. Each player will then be allocated a colour randomly – either red or white. The player allocated the white colour will go first and each player will be given the opportunity to drop a token onto the board until either player has 4 tokens in a row or there are no more possible moves.

## Assignment 2 Details
```
You have been approached by a company to create a front­end system for a vending machine written in C. The vending machine serves all kinds of pastry treats. The company’s name is Penelope’s Pastry Delights and as such, the executable you are creating will be called “ppd” Note: for this assignment you may use either gcc or clang which are both installed on the coreteaching machines. Many developers prefer to use clang as they feel that it provides more friendly error messages. clang accepts the same arguments as gcc so there should not be any problem there.

The concepts covered include:
- Command line arguments.
- File handling.
- Dynamic memory allocation and linked lists.
- Modularisation and multi­file programs.
- Makefiles.
- Function pointers
- All concepts covered in Assignment #1.
